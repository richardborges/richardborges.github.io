Who would have thought DevOps could be so intersting? I read a version of this about 5 years ago and recently found that there is a Kindle version avaialble. 
The book is 
#### The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win Kindle Edition 
##### by Gene Kim (Author), Kevin Behr (Author), George Spafford (Author) 
A wonderful read and very relatable.
