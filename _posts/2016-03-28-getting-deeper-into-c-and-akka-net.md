Been reading the wonderful tips and tricks in C# by Jason Roberts , bought to you by <a href="https://leanpub.com/book_search?search=Jason+Roberts" target="_blank">LeanPub</a>.
  
Also created a web project using signalR and Akka.net (following the Jason Roberts course in <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/akkadotnet-signalr-stateful-reactive-concurrent-spas" target="_blank">Pluralsight</a>) . SignalR takes care of the communications between the (browser) client and (web) server, while Akka.net takes care of the (heavy) message processing. All very fascinating and works well under load
