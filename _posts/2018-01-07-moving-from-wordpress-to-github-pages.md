I was finally prodded into action when my blog site certificate expired. 

Using a few excellent resources are available on the interwebs, I was able to run (generate in jekyll) the site locally on a Windows 10 machine. 

The main steps where
1. Install jekyll on Windows 10 bash ( Bash on Ubuntu on Windows ) using instructions at https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/
2. How to run locally ?
    1. Open a bash shell window
    2. bash$ cd /mnt/d/RichardBorges.github.io
    3. bash$ bundle exec jekyll serve
    4. browse to  http://127.0.0.1:4000
