I've been listening to podcasts about electron apps at [DotNetRocks](https://www.dotnetrocks.com/) (episode 1336 )

as well as Scott Hanselmans podcast [Creating cross-platform Electron apps with Jessica Lord](http://www.hanselminutes.com/534/creating-cross-platform-electron-apps-with-jessica-lord).Both are very informative. Jessica also has an interesting blog post at [essential electron](http://jlord.us/essential-electron/). So I picked up a course on Pluralsight by Rob Connery.

First impressions : using node server to create a desktop application was quite new to me and I had to get my head around having a node server running locally to serve up content in a chromium browser. All local.

We can create apps for Windows, Mac and Linux. Although I used CSS , Jquery and quite a bit of JavaScript for the node server libraries, I had to stop myself thinking in the web paradigm. This is a desktop app after all and you can use Ctrl+D to debug your JavaScript. You can use file dialog ! Fascinating. I enjoyed using my web development experience to create a windows app.
