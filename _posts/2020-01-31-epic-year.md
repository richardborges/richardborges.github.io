New Year's resolutions are always hard when you visit them in February.

So this year I've waited till the end of January to make mine. I was inspired by this post [The Ultimate Guide to your best year ever](http://sourcesofinsight.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-your-best-year-ever/)

What a fantastic post, and its by non other than J.D.Meier of [Getting Results the Agile Way](http://sourcesofinsight.com/getting-results-the-agile-way/) fame. I purchased that one a while ago.

Also this post by Scott Hanselman [Advice to my 20 year old self](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/AdviceToMy20YearOldSelf.aspx) helped.

In short order, in 2020 I will focus on getting fitter, study with deliberate practice and become mindful of my work life balance. I've got plans...
