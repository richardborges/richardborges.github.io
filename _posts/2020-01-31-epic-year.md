New Year's resolutions don't always seem to stick, when you visit them in February.

So this year I've waited till the end of January to make mine. I was inspired by this post [The Ultimate Guide to your best year ever](http://sourcesofinsight.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-your-best-year-ever/) which breaks it down real nice. Here are a few gems:
* decide this will be your best year...ever. Will you do your life's work (programming) starting this year?
* adopt a growth mindset, adopt an abundance mindset, adopt a mastery mindset
* "Who do you need to become, to be the kind of person you want to be?"
* "Who do you want to be, and what experiences do you want to create?"
* Word for the Year: Epic
* Daily habits, set Goals and Inspired actions
* A attitude of Gratitude
* "Don't Let Yesterday Take Up Too Much of Today" - Will Rogers

What a fantastic post, and it is written by none other than J.D.Meier of [Getting Results the Agile Way](http://sourcesofinsight.com/getting-results-the-agile-way/) fame. I purchased that one a while ago.

Also this post by Scott Hanselman [Advice to my 20 year old self](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/AdviceToMy20YearOldSelf.aspx) helped especially:
* Avoid drama, in relationships and friends
* Network your butt off. Talk to everyone nice.
* Make sure they aren’t transactional networkers
* Nice people don’t keep score
* They generously share their network
* And ask for nothing in return but your professionalism

My own catch phrases are:
  * Smile
  * Calm Down
  * Let it go
  * Be nice

In short order, in 2020 I will focus on getting fitter, study with deliberate practice and become mindful of my work life balance. I've got plans...
