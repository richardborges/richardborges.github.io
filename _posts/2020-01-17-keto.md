_[Updated 14 Feb 2020]_ In addition to weight loss and mental clarity, some people have reported being able to reverse type 2 diabetes with a keto lifestyle. My personal benefits have been:
* higher energy levels
* mental clarity

I have been on this journey since Aug 2016 and have benefitted from [non-scale victories](https://www.ketogenicforums.com/c/progress/non-scale-victories).

To get started with keto [a low carbohydrate high fat diet], begin by listening to this podcast [Getting started](http://2ketodudes.com/show.aspx?episode=1). There are over a hundred episodes in this podcast, so take your time and at a minimum, listen to the first 13.

There is also plenty of reading to do. Each episodes contains show notes where you can delve deeper into the science.

What do I eat ? I hear you ask. 

In my view to embrace keto you have to learn to cook for yourself. Here are a few [recipes](http://2ketodudes.com/recipes.aspx). Scroll down to the bottom for the easier ones, my go-to being the Fathead pizza. 

Got some questions? have a look here  [https://www.ketogenicforums.com/](https://www.ketogenicforums.com/) or ask me about my experiences. Please consult your doctor as well.

Welcome to the ketogenic lifestyle.
