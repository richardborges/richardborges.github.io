Here is an opportunity to learn new skills in 30 days, investing about an hour a day (give or take a few week ends)

Microsoft 30 days learn </a>

I am planning to invest time in these three:


**DevOps Engineer** 

- Design and implement DevOps processes and practices. 
- Develop an instrumentation strategy with logging, telemetry, and monitoring.
- Manage source control with GitHub to foster collaboration and automate build and deployment processes.


**Azure Developer**

- Participate in all phases of cloud development to create end-to-end solutions. 
- Design, build, test, and maintain cloud applications using compute, storage, management, and security services on Azure.

**Azure Solutions Architect**

- Discover how to use Azure Infrastructure to improve your applications and become an Azure Solution Architect. 
- Advise stakeholders and translate business requirements into cloud solutions.


I plan to stick with the daily learning. It helps that I am familiar with the material :smiley: .
