On my DevOps learning journey, I came across this useful resource [title](https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net) containing templates with readymade build and release pipelines.

Once the selected project is loaded into your Azure Devops organisation ( I create my own personal one, separate from work, as a sandbox in Azure Devops) you can see the prepopulated Boards, Pipelines, Repos etc. You can now build and deploy to your own instance. 
**Bonus**: They even have a **Parts Unlimited** package of 'The Phoenix Project' fame. Nice.
