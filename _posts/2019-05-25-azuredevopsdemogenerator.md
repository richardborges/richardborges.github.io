On my DevOps learning journey, I came across this useful resource [azuredevopsdemogenerator](https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net) containing templates with pre-made build and release pipelines. Once the selected project is loaded into your Azure Devops organisation ( I created my own personal organisation there, separate from the work one, as a sandbox in Azure Devops) you can see the prepopulated Boards, Pipelines, Repos etc. You can now build and deploy to your own instance.

**Bonus**: They even have a **Parts Unlimited** package of 'The Phoenix Project' fame. So if you have read the book, this makes it real. Nice.
