Attended NDC sydney and quite enjoyed it. This is a 3 day conference held at the Hilton in Sydney CBD. They even organise a childrens coding camp before the start of the conference. Thats a nice touch.

Attended quite a few talks over the 3 days.

### The sessions
The ones that stand out for me were
- ASP.Net Core 2.1 - the out of the box benefits
- Using Async-Await correctly in C#
- Team culture ( e.g. no blame retrospectives )
- React + GraphQL + Docker
