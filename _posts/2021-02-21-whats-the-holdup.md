So. Its been a while since my last post. I really should make, posting at regular intervals, a habit. 
Whats my cadence? I'll try a few things to find what suits me best.

I've been following/reading : 
<a href="https://twitter.com/profgalloway" target="_blank">Scott Galloway</a>

and listening to <a href="https://hanselminutes.com/719/myself-its-not-weird-at-all" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman podcasts</a>, especially this one, where Scott says "... I blog twice a week consistently for 20 years. And I podcast every Thursday for the last 15 years, 14 years. And the reason that that works is that I'm not doing it five days a week.."

Something to aspire to.

I've had my eye on this book for a while [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/)

This is just a short note to myself. 
More soon.
