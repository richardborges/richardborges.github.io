So. Its been a while since my last post. I really should make, posting at regular intervals, a habit. 
What's my comfortable cadence? I'll try a few things to find what suits me best.

I've been following/reading : 
<a href="https://twitter.com/profgalloway" target="_blank">Scott Galloway</a>, some thought provoking insights on life, relationships and wealth

and listening to <a href="https://hanselminutes.com/719/myself-its-not-weird-at-all" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman podcasts</a>, especially this one, where Scott says 
>... I blog twice a week consistently for 20 years. And I podcast every Thursday for the last 15 years, 14 years. And the reason that that works is that I'm not doing it five days a week..

Something for me to aspire to.

I've had my eye on this book for a while [](https://dataintensive.net/)<a href="https://dataintensive.net" target="_blank">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a>

This is just a short note to myself. 
More soon.
