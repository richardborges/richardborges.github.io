I am still coming to grips with the power of SignalR. In this demo (from PluralSight.com &#8220;ASP.NET MVC 5 Fundamentals &#8221; by Scott Allen), performance monitoring data is streamed to a browser client. SignalR is used in ASP.Net with MVC5. In this case windows authentication was used to authenticate the user on the client (understandably so). http://smoothiecharts.org/ javascript was used to display the graphs. All very nice.
