To come to grips with react, I completing a few courses on react at PluralSight, which helped me get a better understanding of react.

I also found the facebook maintained react page worth a visit.

### Create React App
Visit [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) which contains step by step instructions.

### Additional resources
I was trying to add a react component to an ASP.Net MVC page. This page  [The Minimal React + Webpack 4 + Babel Setup](https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/) proved very helpful.
