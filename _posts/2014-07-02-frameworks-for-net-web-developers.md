With all the different frameworks to be found for Web development, I came across this <a title="top-must-know-frameworks-for-net-web-developers (Ugo Lattanzi)" href="http://tostring.it/2014/06/30/top-must-know-frameworks-for-net-web-developers/" target="_blank">link</a>, by Ugo Lattanzi, which offers a good summary. The ASP.MVC link therein links on to free PluralSight courses. Good learning. BTW I have re-newed with Pluralsight. Great value for money IMHO.
